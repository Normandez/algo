# Algorithms
* Reverse Array - simple reverse array (or string) algo, recursive and iterator realizations are provided
* Caesar Encrypt (Caesar Cipher) - simple encryption/hashing algo, ASCII-codes based realization are provided (only for latin strings)
* XOR Cipher - simple symmetric encryption by passed key via XOR (^) byte operation
* Fibonacci Sequence - recursive, iterator and formula realizations are provided
* Factorial Sequence - recursive and iterator realizations are provided
* RLE Compression - simple RLE compression algorithm realization for strings, limitation - no digits in unencoded line and valid format for encoded line
* Permutation Generation - generation of permutation sequences.
